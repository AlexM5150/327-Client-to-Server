For compiling we used the terminal enviroment to run the files first using the cd command to get into the local directory where our files were located. 
Then we ran both files using the javac command followed by the java filename ex: javac Server.java 
Then we opened the server using the java command followed by the filename ex: java Server
The user was then prompted to choose a port for the server to be on
Then we ran the client file using the java command followed by the filename ex: java Client 
Then the user is prompted to enter the ip address of the server (localhost if server is on same machine) and the port that the server is on 
Then the user is prompted to enter a message to send to the server
Then the server would respond with an echo that converts the message into uppercase ex: Message: hello, Reply: HELLO
Once the connection to the server has been made infinite messages and replies can be sent back and forth.
